# Fetch Frontend Exercise

## Project Overview

This is my submission for the Fetch Rewards Frontend Take-Home Exercise. The application allows users to search through a database of shelter dogs to help find homes for these animals. Users can filter dogs by breed, sort results, and select their favorites to generate a personalized match.
